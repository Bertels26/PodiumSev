Podium Severity Model

Calculates severity by adding/removing a "selected" class when a box is clicked,
then summing the values of the 'data-weight' attribute from each selected box.

Guide to updating:
- To update the weights, update the data-weight attribute for a button in index.html
- To update thresholds, update the variables at the top of app.js


Betterment opportunities:
- bigger, bolder title (without making the page too big for a small Mac screen)
- make ARR lines smaller (text size)
- darkmode/lightmode toggle
- "clear" button positioning
